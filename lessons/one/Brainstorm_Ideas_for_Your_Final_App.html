            <p>
              Some of you will roll right though this project, and others will
              really struggle. No matter your situation, it’s a good idea to
              log your answers to the questions we’ll ask. You could do this
              by creating text files to capture your responses, or perhaps log
              them on a blog.
              <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> is a great, free, blogging tool you can
              use to get started.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're shy, and don't want to share your work publicly, please
              do log your answers in a file on your computer, or use the boxes
              provided in the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
              Logging your experience has important benefits:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Working through the steps will keep you from getting stalled.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a cohort you will build up a useful body of information that
                others can learn from.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will have a chance to find other students working on
                similar challenges, allowing you to collaborate.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              When I was an electrical engineering student at UCF, my team
              kept a <a href="http://seniordesign-rocketgals.blogspot.com/">
                blog</a> to log the progress of our Senior Design Project: a
                rocket with an electronic IMU to track velocity, acceleration,
                and altitude. Not only did it help our team solidify our
                learnings, but it's also fun to look back at!

            <h4><strong>The Personal Motivation behind Your App Ideas</strong></h4>
            <p>
              Sammy’s example served two purposes: he built an app to satisfy
              one of his interests (reading comics) and overcame a frustration
              (inability to find a good app to read digital comics).
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal motivation can really serve you well when developing an
              app. Like Sammy said, if the app is something you want to use,
              it's a lot easier to keep wanting to work on it - even when the
              going gets tough.
            </p>
            <p>
              So take some time to think about those things that aggravate and
              inspire you, and jot down ways an app might help. It's a good
              idea to think on this for a couple days as you go about your
              routine. After all, you may not think about some frustrations
              until you experience them.

            <h4> 11. Quiz: Ideas From Featured Apps </h4>
            <h4><strong>Browsing Apple's Featured App Store Apps</strong></h4>
            <p>
              If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can access the featured apps
              by selecting the App Store app, and the "Featured" tab at the
              bottom.
            </p>

              <img src="../../assets/appstore.png" class="img-responsive
              text-center" alt="app store">
            </p>
            <p>
              <em class="text-center">
                (Note: These apps are relevant to the device you're using:
                iPhones will show the top apps for iPhone and iPads will show
                the top apps for iPad.)
              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't have an iOS device, you can browse the top free and
              paid apps online
              <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/charts/free-apps/">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a minute to browse these apps and see what inspiration
              strikes. Jot those ideas down, and start thinking about how you
              might improve upon these apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another approach to this exercise might be to scale down a
              version of a popular app, so also keep that in mind as you browse
              through the apps.
