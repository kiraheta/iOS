            <h4> 10. Note on IBOutlets, IBActions, and Constraints </h4>
            <p>
              Here are a few items to help you along the way:
            </p>
            <p>
              <blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">
                Did you notice the filled in circles in the Xcode editor gutter
                next to IBOutlets and IBActions?
              </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              They are supposed to indicate when the IBOutlets or IBActions are
              wired up to a UI Element. Unfortunately, there is a bug in Xcode.
              These circles will only fill in once you open the Main.Storyboard
              file. If you just started Xcode and open a view controller, you
              may be wondering if you connected these or not. Well, you likely
              did, and Xcode has just not read the Main.Storyboard file to
              figure it out.
            </p>
            <blockquote style="font-size: 14px;">
              Are you noticing that your label and/or button are out of place?
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This is likely because you've not provided enough constraints or
              you've provided the incorrect constraints. But don't worry, that
              is a fixable problem, and later in the course, we will provide an
              even better solution for laying out UI elements. Note, it is
              often useful to take a careful look at your constraints and work
              out on paper how they would behave in different device sizes and
              orientations.

            <h4> 14. More Info on AutoLayout </h4>
            <p>
              There are several ways to determine which AutoLayout Constraints
              you will need. The steps we’ve shown so far—to position the two
              buttons and the label in our app—take you through Apple’s
              recommended path for knowing what constraints to create.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may seem like a lot of work, but AutoLayout is really useful
              in setting up user interfaces to work well for the differently
              sized screens of the various iOS devices.
            </p>

              In programming, you have to keep the attitude of a child. You
              have to be willing to experiment and to try new things. You can’t
              really break anything at this point, you are just positioning UI
              Elements. Even if Xcode is complaining at you, which it will,
              don’t give up, just go back into thinking about the small steps
              you need to get to your goal. Don’t be afraid to try things out
              in Xcode.
